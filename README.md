Pomodoro Focus Timer
Pomodoro Focus Timer is a productivity tool inspired by the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. This application aids you in maintaining focus by dividing your work sessions into dedicated time intervals, traditionally 25 minutes, separated by short breaks.

Features:
Customizable Timer Durations: Set your preferred focus and break durations to tailor your productivity sessions.
Intuitive Interface: Begin, pause, or reset your timer with a straightforward and user-friendly UI.
Audible Alerts: Sounds notify you when a focus session has ended and a break begins, ensuring you stick to your schedule.
Session Count: Keep track of how many Pomodoro sessions you've completed in a day.
How It Works:
Focus Time: Start a 25-minute timer to work on a task or study. Commit to not getting distracted during this interval.
Short Break: Once your session ends, take a 5-minute short break. Step away from your desk, stretch, or grab a quick snack.
Repeat: After four focus sessions, take a longer break, typically 10 minutes, to recharge and reset.
Benefits of the Pomodoro Technique:
Enhanced Focus: By working in shorter bursts, it's easier to maintain a high level of focus and performance.
Clear Breaks: Regular breaks ensure you don't burn out and help maintain a high level of productivity throughout your day.
Track Progress: By counting the number of Pomodoros, you can track your productivity and see how much time you've dedicated to a task.
